# Flombo - Flag Combos!

A friend of mine came up with a game whereby he'd take two countries and mash their flags together. The player's task was to tease apart which two country's flags had been combined, and *then* figure out the third (actual!) country name they represented by taking letters from the start and end of the first two countries.

I tried to explain that and I think it's probably more confusing afterwards.

Here's an example:

Can you tell which country flags have been combined?

That's right! It's Canada and Greece!

And if we take the first three letters of GREece and the last four letters of caNADA and mash them together, what do you get?

GRENADA -- the name of another country!

So we can pretend like this is the flag of Grenada, which it's not. But that's the game.

I decided to whip up a quick script to try to determine all of the possibilities. In my friend's original version, the flags were artfully combined. In my version, I just wanted to check out which ones were valid. And that's what you see here!

# The Results

Here are the results in *flag form* for you to try to guess. Don't scroll too quickly or you'll see the text translation and spoil all of the answers!
